From September 2016 to June 2020, I studied at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) and obtained a bachelor's degree in engineering.
From September 2020, I will study for a doctorate degree at the [National University of Defense Technology](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/), ChangSha. I was supervised by Zhu En and [Xinwang Liu (刘新旺)](https://xinwangliu.github.io/).


I am now working on ***Multi-modal Data Analysis***, ***Scalable Unsupervised Learning*** and ***graph learning***. I have published 20+ papers at the top international AI conferences and journals, such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and IEEE TIP, TKDE, TNNLS. I also serve as reviewer for top conferences, including ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and ACM MM.

For scalable unsupervised learning, we have built a comprehensive [awesome-deep-multi-view-clustering-repository](https://github.com/jinjiaqi1998/Awesome-Deep-Multi-View-Clustering). We have also built a data repository for [large-scale multi-view data](https://github.com/wangsiwei2010/large_scale_multi-view_clustering_datasets). 

If you are seeking any form of ***academic cooperation***, please feel free to email me at [dzb20@nudt.edu.cn](mailto:dzb20@nudt.edu.cn).

From 2023.06, I am an assistant professor at Academy of Military Sciences, Beijing.

I graduated from the Department of Computer Science, [National University of Defense Technology](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/), with a bachelor/master/doctor degree(国防科技大学计算机学院), advised by [Xinwang Liu (刘新旺)](https://xinwangliu.github.io/) and [En Zhu (祝恩)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou) 2013-2023. I also collaborate with Sihang Zhou (周思航), [Changqing Zhang (张长青)](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/zhangchangqing/index.html) and [Chang Tang(唐厂)](https://tangchang.net/)  closely. 


I am now working on ***Multi-modal Analysis***, ***Scalable unsupervised learning*** and ***LLM agent planning***. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5o9hK3EAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fwangsiwei2010%2Fwangsiwei2010.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences and journals, such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI and IEEE TPAMI, TIP, TKDE, TNNLS. 

For scalable unsupervised learning, we have built a comprehensive [awesome-multi-view-clustering-repository](https://github.com/wangsiwei2010/awesome-multi-view-clustering). We have also built a data repository for [large-scale multi-view data](https://github.com/wangsiwei2010/large_scale_multi-view_clustering_datasets).
